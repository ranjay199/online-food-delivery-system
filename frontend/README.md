- **xl**: ≥1200px (Large desktop)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Bundle size warning (exceeds 500KB budget) - normal for development
- External images may be blocked by ad blockers
- Service worker not implemented (would improve caching)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real backend API integration
- [ ] Payment gateway integration
